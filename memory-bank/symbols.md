## 📁 File Symbols

- 📂 = `/memory-bank/` - Memory bank root directory
- 📦 = `/memory-bank/backups/` - Backup storage directory

## 📚 Memory Files (𝕄)

- σ₁ = 📋`projectbrief.md` - Project overview, requirements & scope
- σ₂ = 🏛️`systemPatterns.md` - Architecture patterns & design decisions
- σ₃ = 💻`techContext.md` - Technology stack & environment details
- σ₄ = 🔮`activeContext.md` - Current focus, recent changes & next steps
- σ₅ = 📊`progress.md` - Project status, milestones & tracking

## 🧠 Task Operations (𝕋)

- 𝕋[0:3] = Research operations: read_files, ask_questions, observe_code, document_findings
- 𝕋[4:6] = Innovation operations: suggest_ideas, explore_options, evaluate_approaches
- 𝕋[7:9] = Planning operations: create_plan, detail_specifications, sequence_steps
- 𝕋[10:12] = Execution operations: implement_code, follow_plan, test_implementation
- 𝕋[13:15] = Review operations: validate_output, verify_against_plan, report_deviations

## 🔄 RIPER Modes (Ω)

- Ω₁ = 🔍**R**ESEARCH - Investigation & information gathering
- Ω₂ = 💡**I**NNOVATE - Ideation & solution exploration
- Ω₃ = 📝**P**LAN - Strategic planning & specification
- Ω₄ = ⚙️**E**XECUTE - Implementation & development
- Ω₅ = 🔎**R**E**V**IEW - Validation & quality assurance

## 🏗️ Project Phases (Π)

- Π₁ = 🌱**UNINITIATED** - Framework installed, project not started
- Π₂ = 🚧**INITIALIZING** - START phase active, setup ongoing
- Π₃ = 🏗️**DEVELOPMENT** - Main development với RIPER active
- Π₄ = 🔧**MAINTENANCE** - Long-term support với RIPER active

## 🏁 START Phase Steps (S)

- S₀ = Create memory directories (📂, 📦)
- S₁ = Gather requirements → create σ₁
- S₂ = Select technologies → update σ₃
- S₃ = Define architecture → create σ₂
- S₄ = Scaffold project → create directories
- S₅ = Setup environment → initialize memory system

## 🎯 Cross-References (χ)

- Standard format: `[↗️σ₁:R₁]` - Links to requirement R₁ trong σ₁
- Issue reference: `[⚠️Issue #N]` - Links to known issues
- Technical debt: `[💳TD #N]` - Links to technical debt items

## ⚠️ Safety Protocols (Δ)

- Δ₁ = Destructive operations require warning + confirmation + backup
- Δ₂ = Phase transitions require verification + backup + update
- Δ₃ = Reinitialization requires warning + confirmation + backup
- Δ₄ = Errors require reporting + recovery suggestions

## 📊 Status Indicators

- ✅ = Completed/Working
- 🔄 = In Progress/Active
- ⏳ = Planned/Pending
- ⚠️ = Warning/Issue
- 🐛 = Bug/Problem
- 💳 = Technical Debt
- 🎯 = Target/Goal
- 🚀 = Enhancement/Feature

## 🎮 Project-Specific Symbols

- 📱 = Android/Mobile related
- 📺 = TV/Leanback specific
- 🎮 = Gaming/Blacknut related
- 🔐 = Authentication/Security
- 🎬 = Media/ExoPlayer related
- 🌐 = Network/API related
- 🎨 = UI/Compose related
